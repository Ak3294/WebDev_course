<!-- In this tutorial, we are going to start our first HTML tutorial. 
In the last tutorial, we have learnt about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and 
how the web server reverts with the response after getting the request. 
We will now learn about how to write HTML code in the Visual Studio Code.

It is a free open source IDE from Microsoft which makes our work a lot easier. 
Therefore, I recommend everyone to download this software and install it. 
Make a folder named “Complete Web development” and then open VS Code 
in that folder by pressing right-click > Open with code. In case, you can’t find 
the option of opening the particular folder with Visual Studio, you can restart your PC or 
laptop to make sure that changes have taken place after you installed VS Code.

“Akshay.html” is an example of a very simple HTML file in which we make further 
changes to make it look professional. Although you can write all the HTML, CSS, 
and JavaScript codes in Notepad, I’ll not recommend doing so. This is because in Notepad 
you have to make different files and edit them one by one and also it does not provide the 
option of syntax highlighting. And, I would recommend using the Chrome Browser due to its 
nice functionality and amazing dev tools.

If you are using the Visual Studio Code for the first time, 
it may look a little complicated to you. But as you keep practicing on it, 
believe me, it will make your work effortless and easy. Also, 
if you are going to write codes of Python or any other language in the future, 
the VS code IDE will definitely be going to help you. You will find five main buttons on the left panel of the VS Code. 
These are Explorer, Search, Git, Debugger, and Extensions. 

One of the most important extensions that I would recommend to install is Live Server. 
After installing it, refresh the Visual Studio Code and click on the Go Live option in the right bottom. 
The advantage we get by using this extension is that it automatically makes changes in the web page whatever 
you write in the HTML code.

There are two types of settings options in the Visual Studio Code. The first set of settings is the user 
settings which are used to manage the user and whole VS code. The second set is the Workspace settings which 
is for only the particular workspace (opened folder) in which you are currently working. 
You can also change the keyboard shortcuts according to your needs to make your work efficient.

So these are some basic knowledge and tips about the Visual Studio Code. I hope you have understood all 
the concepts very easily. The software works the same in macOS and Linux.   -->
