<!-- For every website to be designed, HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a must. 
This is the skeleton of a website. Without it, no website can run. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) 
adds beauty to that website and JavaScript adds the brain to allow the functioning of that website. 
Therefore, CSS and JavaScript add beauty and brain to a particular website respectively. 

Let us now take another example of a car. The HTML acts as the metallic body of a car and the 
CSS acts as the color and design of the car. Finally, the engine of a car is like the JavaScript 
on the website to add functionality. 

Normally, a client or a user sends a request to the webserver of the website, he wants to visit. 
The web server that has its own IP address stores all the files in the backend which can be written 
in PHP, Python, or Node.js. The web server sends a response to the client in the form of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Finally, to understand-

HTML is used as a standard language for any website design. It acts as a static skeleton to a web application. 
It’s a well-standardized system.CSS is used to handle the presentation of the web page. 
It makes the website look attractive and beautiful.JavaScript allows scripting on your website and makes 
it completely dynamic in nature. 
It provides front end scripting for your website and is a high-level dynamic interpreted programming language.
Now, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript have a lot of concepts in them which we will take over through the span of this course. 
Therefore, it cannot be learned all at once. If you are a beginner, learning HTML up to 80%, CSS up to 40-60%, and 
JavaScript up to 50-70% will be more than enough to start building websites. 
This is something nobody in the web development industry talks about and hence 
I thought to share this personal advice with all of you.  
Please don't get me wrong when I say that. 
Once you have learned and understood the bare minimum to build a website you can come back to the course and 
start watching it once again for perfecting and sharpening the already learned concepts. 
Sometimes following this practice gets difficult, the good news is that once you start watching these videos and 
get your hands dirty with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the rest you will gradually learn based upon your 
practices and experiences with the help of projects I have designed as a part of this course. 
You need to learn all the concepts simultaneously and co-relate all the things by practicing them. -->
